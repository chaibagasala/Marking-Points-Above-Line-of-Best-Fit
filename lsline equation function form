function linevalues(val,m,b,vector)
%This function finds the y-axis values for a line
%where you know the x-axis values you want.
%Use this function if you know the expected number of values.
%The code creates a vector of zeros and replaces them.
%val is the expected number of values.
%m is the slope of the line.
%b is the y-int. of the line.
%vector is the vector holding the desired x-axis values.
A = zeros(1,val);
x = 1;
while x < (val+1)
    A(x) = (m*vector(x) + b);
    x = x + 1;
end

%c=Call the function with lslineEquation(x,y,z) in command line or elsewhere. 
%Use the specifications as outlined in the comments above.
