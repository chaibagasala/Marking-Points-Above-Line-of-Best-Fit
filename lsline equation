%Both methods will return a 1x2 vector.
%The first value is the slope, the second value is the y-int.

%Find the equation for lsline (line of best fit)!
h = lsline ;
p2 = polyfit(get(h,'xdata'),get(h,'ydata'),1)

%Or find the equation of the line of best fit using the vectors involved!
x = input('x-axis vector: ');
y = input('y-axis vector: ');
plot(x,y,'bo');
p = polyfit(x,y,1)
