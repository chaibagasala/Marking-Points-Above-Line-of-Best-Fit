function lslineEquation(x,y,z)
%This function finds the equation for the line of best fit!
%x is a vector containing the x-axis values of your data.
%y is a vector containing the y-axis values of your data.
%x and y must be vectors of equal size.
%If you have lsline z must be 'yes'.
%Anything else will conclude you do not have lsline.
%The resulting 1x2 matrix contains the slope and y-int,
%using slope intercept form, you can construct the equation of lsline.
plot(x,y,'ro');
if z == 'yes'
    h = lsline;
    polyfit(get(h,'xdata'),get(h,'ydata'),1)
else
    polyfit(x,y,1)
end

%Call the function with lslineEquation(x,y,z).
%Use specifications as outlined in the comments above.
